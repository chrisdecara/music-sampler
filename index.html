    <p>If you have yet to stumble upon the absolute monolith of a band known as <em>Rush</em>, allow me to introduce you to one of the most influential and iconic bands of the last century! Since their debut in 1974, <em>Rush</em> has actively put out multiple albums a decade, only ceasing in 2015 following the death of one of its members.</p><p>To many, <em>Rush</em> reminds people of a time that, despite not being all that long ago, feels like a drastically different world than that of the modern day. Many of the band's songs focus on ideas of rebellion, denying social norms and seeking out individualism in an increasingly corporate world.</p><p>The following four song samples ("Subdivisions," "Limelight," "A Passage to Bangkok" and "Working Man") are some of the most well-known and celebrated works in their entirey discography.</p>
